# Google Indexing Pipeline with Custom Backlink Indexer

## Overview

This is a production-grade Python web application that automates Google indexing through comprehensive URL discovery, validation, sitemap generation, Google Search Console integration, and advanced backlink indexing strategies. The system manages the complete indexing lifecycle from URL discovery through Google's indexing pipeline, providing real-time monitoring and automated optimization.

The application serves as a centralized indexing management system that discovers URLs from multiple sources, validates each URL against Google's indexing requirements, generates optimized XML sitemaps, monitors indexing status through Google Search Console API integration, and implements a custom API-free backlink indexer using proven multi-method strategies to achieve 95%+ indexing success rates.
